# Week 07 | Homework

Your task is to design an interactive, exploratory Tableau dashboard of the pharmaceutical data that helps users discover insights or trends.

## 1) Tableau Dashboard of the Pharmaceutical Data

You will first learn about Tableau dashboards and then design your dashboard. You will have to fine-tune some of the visualizations you have created during class over the last weeks and then combine them into an interactive dashboard. Your dashboard must use some [filters](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm), [filter actions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm), [highlight actions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_highlight.htm), and at least one [embedded tooltip visualization](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/viz_in_tooltip.htm). You must also implement an advanced Tableau visualization that requires more work and is not part of Tableau's "Show Me" feature.


### Task 1.1: Learn how to create a Tableau dashboard

- Begin by watching this instructive [tutorial](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/how-to-videos) on how to create an interactive Dashboard in Tableau.
- Read the [Dashboard's Done Right](https://www.tableau.com/learn/get-started/dashboards) article and follow the links to learn more about [Filter Actions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm) and [Highlight Actions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_highlight.htm).
- Browse the [Tableau training videos](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training). We recommend using internet search engines to learn about specific aspects of Tableau. 

### Task 1.2: Sketch your dashboard

- First, decide which visualizations you want to include in your dashboard. You can include up to three visualizations you have worked on during class activities.
- Design an *advanced visualization* that is not part of Tableau's "Show Me" feature. Get inspired by the visual vocabulary Tableau workbook that we posted on Quercus. First, create a **sketch of your advanced visualization** on pen and paper (or a tablet). 
- **Sketch a preliminary layout** of your dashboard on paper. It is easiest if you use sticky notes for the individual visualizations, which allows you to move them around and arrange them in the dashboard sketch. Include titles, captions, legends, and axis labels in your sketches. 

### Task 1.3: Implement your visualizations

- Finish your easy-to-implement visualizations first. As we said, you can re-use up to three visualizations you have worked on during class activities. Or you can create new ones, e.g., similar to the ones we created for the World Indicator dataset. 
- Create your advanced visualization. Find help online using your favorite search engine. There are many tutorial videos on the Tableau website and YouTube.
- Make sure to use a [filter](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm) in at least one of your visualizations. Filters allow the user to select a range of quantitative or categorical data for display.
- Make sure your visualizations have appropriate and well-formatted tooltips. Implement at least one tooltip that shows an [embedded tooltip visualization](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/viz_in_tooltip.htm).

### Task 1.4: Improve your visualization designs

- Fine-tune your visualizations to include meaningful titles, captions, axis labels, legends, and annotations.
- Make sure to use a consistent color scheme across your visualizations.
- Double-check that you are using efficient encodings for your data.
- Do your visualizations answer the questions effectively? Are they appropriate for your audience? 

### Task 1.5: Implement your dashboard

- Create your dashboard in Tableau and arrange all the individual views per your dashboard sketch. We recommend using [containers](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/harry-cooney/dashboard-formatting-with-containers-in-tableau/) for easier layout implementation. You can also make dashboard elements [floating](https://www.tableau.com/drive/floating-versus-tiled-dashboards). 
- Make sure you select the appropriate [size and dimension](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_organize_floatingandtiled.htm) of your dashboard.
- Make sure your [filter](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm) is visible and in a good position in the dashboard.  
- Use [Filter Actions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_filter.htm) and [Highlight Actions](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/actions_highlight.htm) in your dashboard. 
- Ensure your dashboard has a title and that visualizations have appropriate titles and legends. As desired, add captions to your visualizations. Include all necessary legends.
- Finally, make sure your dashboard design looks nice and has a consistent color scheme. Consider adjusting the margins and background colors of your containers.

### Task 1.6: Write down the goals you had

- In a PDF document, together with your dashboard sketch and a screenshot of the final dashboard, record the answers to the following questions:
  * Who is the audience?
  * What are the questions your dashboard is trying to answer?
  * Explore the data using your dashboard and write down **at least three insights** you got. Be specific, i.e., what visualizations or interactions led to those insights? Include screenshots to corroborate your insights. 

## 2) Final Project 

The project phase of the year is about to start & we will address the logistics of the final projects in great detail during Thursday's lecture. For this week, your only task is to fill out the form provided on Quercus in the `Final Project` module.
  

## 3) Submit Homework in Quercus

Please submit your homework as a single zip file (including the twbx workbook and a PDF of your dashboard sketch, screenshots, and answers to the questions).

## Grading

The TAs will use the following design critique to grade your dashboards. As you know, there are no hard and fast rules for "good" and "bad" visualizations. Instead, we rely on the expertise and experience of our TAs. You should check the design critique below to ensure you address all the concerns. 

1. Goals
- Is the dashboard appropriate for the audience?
- Is the dashboard successful in answering the questions?
- Did you get at least three insights into the data from your dashboard?

2. Visual Channels
- What visual channels (position, size, (grey) value/luminance, texture, color (saturation and hue), orientation, shape) are used for the data?
- Are the visual channels appropriate for the data types?
- Does the dashboard use pre-attentive (pop-out) channels effectively?
  
3. Design and Effectiveness
- Are Tufteâ€™s principles followed, i.e., do the visualizations:
  * have graphical integrity
  * mind the lie factor
  * maximize data-ink ratio (i.e., keep it simple)
  * avoid chart junk
- How are colors used for different data types? Are the color maps appropriate and consistent?
- Does the dashboard use an overall pleasing layout and color scheme?
- Overall, is the design effective in reducing cognitive load in the viewer?

4. Interactions
-	What interactions does the dashboard use (tooltips, filtering, highlight actions, etc.)?
-	Does it successfully enable exploration (navigation, aggregation, filtering, faceting) of the data?
-	Are the title, captions, annotations, and tooltips effective? 

5. Overall Assessment
- Is the dashboard a success? Why or why not?

**Congratulations on finishing this week's homework! See you in class!**
