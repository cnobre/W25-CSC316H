# Homework 0 - Course Enrollment

Welcome to CSC316!  This initial homework intends to get you acquainted with the structure and set-up of CSC316 to ensure that everything goes smoothly moving forward. Please complete this homework but do not worry, future homework will be a lot more exciting and focused on creating interactive web-based visualizations! :-)

To complete this homework, you will have to do the following steps (which will be explained in more detail below):

1. Get acquainted with the general course structure.
2. Take the initial programming quiz.
3. Familiarize yourself with our online forum Piazza.
4. Set-up Webstorm.

## 1. Course Structure
**Before you continue, please take a look at our syllabus and our weekly schedule overview on our [Quercus site](https://Quercus.harvard.edu/courses/137203)! The syllabus will answer most of your questions!**


We will always post all materials and assignments for each week as a single module on Quercus (by Saturday of the preceding week).

### Class Meeting Times:

**Class:** Monday 2:15pm-3:30pm. Our classes are quite interactive and include many group activities. Please make sure that you arrive on time so you can contribute and participate. 

**Lab:** Wednesday 2:15pm-3:30pm.

Classes start on time!

*Lab note:*

* Labs are mostly self-guided programming tutorials. Labs are intended to be completed during class time. If you cannot finish it in time during class, please finish it at home. It is also a good idea to get started with the lab before actual class time. Labs always have to be submitted together with that week's homework.


### Work done at home:

* In preparation for class each week, you will work on your own through asynchronous materials (YouTube videos, websites, lecture videos, book chapters, etc.) to ensure that you are prepared for the programming labs and the activities in class.
* At the beginning of each lab, you will have to complete a brief quiz that tests your understanding of the asynchronous materials for that week.
* Homework assignments are handed out on Wednesdays and are due the following Wednesday at noon ET.


### Help, questions, feedback:

If you have any questions (administrative or visualization-related), there are several ways to reach out. Please follow the order below:

1. Use our online message board Ed, which is linked in Quercus. Your message can be published either just to the teaching fellows or the entire course.
2. If you can wait until the next class meeting, ask course staff at the end of class.
3. Attend office hours. Office hours will be posted on [Quercus](https://Quercus.harvard.edu/courses/137203/pages/office-hours-2024).
4. Email course staff, either the TF that is mentoring your project team or staff@CSC316.org.

**Where to find help**
* If youâ€™re looking for general information about the class, its syllabus, a listing of the assignments, how we will grade you, or other course policies, you should visit our **Quercus** class site.
* To submit your labs, homework, and final project pieces, you will use **Quercus**.
* If you want to ask a question about the course, the class schedule, or specific assignments, you should post your questions on our **Ed class site**. The teaching staff will also post class-wide announcements on our Ed class site (linked on Quercus).
* If you want to talk to your design sprint team or lab group, please use **Slack** for messaging (linked on Quercus).

## 2. Programming Quiz
Please fill out our programming quiz on Quercus (under HW 0 of the Shopping Week module). This quiz covers very simple programming concepts and should only take you a couple of minutes. If you have trouble with this quiz, we strongly encourage you to take a programming class like CS50 prior to taking CSC316.

<!--
## 4. Studio sign-up
Our studios start already in the third week of the semester, so it is vital that you give us your studio preferences as soon as possible! To sign-up, go to Quercus -> People -> Groups or use [this link](https://Quercus.harvard.edu/courses/30002/groups).
-->

<!-- [DCE]
On-campus students (non DCE), please follow the FAS Sectioning instructions [here](http://about.my.harvard.edu/sectioning-students) to sign up for studios.

DCE students will be assigned into studio groups by us and will get an email from their assigned studio TF by Tuesday of the second week.
-->

## 3. Ed Discussion Forum
Click on the Ed Discussion link on our Quercus page or go to [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/64491/discussion/5184398) and introduce yourself.

[//]: # (<!-- [DCE])

[//]: # (If you are a DCE student and don't have a Harvard e-mail address, please sign up for one [here]&#40;http://g.harvard.edu/extension-school-and-summer-school-faq/extension_opt_in&#41;.-->)

We will use Ed as a forum to discuss, find team members, arrange appointments, and ask questions. Ed should be your primary form of communication with the staff. Use the staff e-mail only for individual requests, e.g., to excuse yourself from a mandatory guest lecture. We will also use Ed to announce important information like room changes, etc.

### Introduction

Once you are signed up to the Ed course forum, please read the posting guidelines and then introduce yourself to your classmates and course staff. Please post as a follow-up in the 'Introductions' thread and include your name/nickname, and tell us something interesting about yourself (e.g., an unusual hobby, past travels, or a cool project you did, etc.).

## 4. Set up Webstorm

JetBrains WebStorm is a JavaScript IDE that we encourage you to use for D3 development in this class. You can download WebStorm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

You can claim a free student license for use in this class [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). Make sure that you use your university email address for this step!

## 5. Enrollment Survey
Please complete the enrollment survey on Quercus (shopping week). It should only take a few minutes to complete, and it will automatically enter you into the CSC316 lottery.

**DCE students:** You are already enrolled in the course, but please still complete HW 0, including the enrollment survey.


## Well done, welcome to CS 1710!
