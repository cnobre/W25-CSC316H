# Week 06 | Homework

This homework requires that you have read and **programmed** along with:

- [csc316-week6-preReading.pdf](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/374366/files/35339447/download?wrap=1)
- [https://scotch.io/tutorials/demystifying-es6-classes-and-prototypal-inheritance](https://scotch.io/tutorials/demystifying-es6-classes-and-prototypal-inheritance) (explanation of JS ES6 Classes with more examples)



## 1) A survey about the diffusion of microfinance loans (10 points)

In this homework you will work with survey data on microfinance loans. Banerjee et al [1] collected the data in order to develop a model of information diffusion in social networks. To come right to the point: you don't need any knowledge or additional information on microfinance. We will only cover a very small part of the collected data to demonstrate you how to visualize survey results efficiently with JS and D3.

The authors of the study collected detailed demographic and network data in 75 villages in India, six months before a microfinance institution began offering their products to these villagers. The combination of the original survey, information about first-informed villagers and results of the subsequent participation made it possible to draw conclusions on the diffusion of information.

If you are interested in the study you can get the paper here:

[1] Banerjee, Abhijit, et al. "The diffusion of microfinance." *Science* (2013).

### Data

- **Household characteristics** has demographic information about a household's home (own or rent, electricity, number of rooms, latrine type, etc.)
- Individual characteristics with detailed demographic information (age, language skills, occupation, etc.) were collected for some households
- Extensive data about relationships between these households

*In this assignment you will only work with the household characteristics dataset. You will have to use the following columns:*
	 
- ```survey``` ... this variable was generated by us. Imagine it is the date when the household was surveyed.
- ```ownrent``` ... if the home is owned, rented or given by government
- ```hohreligion``` ... religion they belong
- ```electricity``` ... whether the household has private/government/no electricity 
- ```latrine``` ... type of latrine (own/common/no) in the household


### Template

To help you get started with this homework assignment we have prepared a template that you can use. It is based on the front-end framework *Bootstrap* and it includes the JS libraries: *D3* and *jQuery*. Furthermore, a CSV file (```household_charateristics.csv```) is stored in the folder *"data"*. Of course, you can also start with an empty project and just copy the dataset.

[Template.zip](https://cnobre.github.io/W25-CSC316H/week-06/hw/week-06-hw-template.zip)


### Overview

In the last lab you have learned how to link multiple views with each other, how to make visualization components reusable and how to use D3's brush component to filter the data.

You should now apply what you have learned to create an interactive visualization with multiple views. Your final webpage should contain an area chart and several barcharts. Whenever the user changes the selection - via the brushing component in the area chart - all the bar charts should be updated accordingly.

*You can use the following mockup as a guide:*

**Implementation checklist:**

- Create a 2-column layout in HTML & CSS
- Implement visualizations (area and bar charts) as reusable components
- Use D3's brushing component to engage users and help them to filter data efficiently
- Link all the bar charts to the selected region of the brushing component
- Use transitions to make changes smoother
- Make your webpage/visualization responsive for different screen sizes 


### Implementation

1. **Download the resources**

	Please download the template and the CSV file as a ZIP file: [Template.zip](https://cnobre.github.io/W25-CSC316H/week-06/hw/week-06-hw-template.zip)

2. **Familiarize yourself with the provided framework and the dataset**
		
3. **Specifiy the webpage layout**

	You should create a 2-column layout in HTML and CSS. The area chart with the time period filter should be in the left column and the bar charts should be in the right column. We have included *Bootstrap* in the template so that you can complete this task quickly.
	
4. **Load the CSV data and create the bar chart objects**

	We have already prepared a few code snippets to help you get started. Open the files ```main.js``` and ```barchart.js``` and get an overview.
	
	Similar to our last lab, you have to implement visualizations as reusable components. This is especially important if you want to use the same visualization type (e.g., bar charts) several times on the same webpage with different data in each visualization.

	The goal is to implement a generic bar chart object in ```barchart.js``` that can be used in ```main.js``` multiple times for these variables:
	
	-  ```ownrent```
	-  ```electricity```
	-  ```latrine```
	-  ```hohreligion```

	Example: You can find the values *Christianity*, *Hinduism* and *Islam* in the column ```hohreligion```. One of your bar charts should show how many households belong to which religion.
	
	![Homework 6 Barchart](assets/cs171-week-06-barchart.png?raw=true "Homework 6 Barchart")
	
	Each bar chart should contain a title, a y-axis and labels for each bar.

	#### Grouping data with d3.group and d3.rollup
	
	D3 includes a powerful functionality to transform a flat data structure into a nested one. Prior version of d3 used ````d3.nest``` for this functionality, but d3 v6 replaced that with [```d3.group```](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group) and  [```d3.rollup()```](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup).  We would highly recommend you to use these function to prepare the data for your bar charts. 	**Example**
	
	*CSV-Data:*
	
	```
	student,city
	John,Boston
	Sarah,Boston
	Stacy,New York
	Anna,London
	Mike,Boston
	```
	
	First, let's use *d3.group()* to group the rows by *city*:
	
	```javascript
	let studentsByCity = d3.group(student,d=>d.city)
	```
	
	As a result we get a map structure:
	
	```javascript
	studentsByCity = 
		Map(3) {
 		 "Boston" => [
			{student: "John", city: "Boston" },
			{student: "Sarah", city: "Boston" },
			{student: "Mike", city: "Boston" }
		]
  		"New York" => [{student: "Stacy", city: "New York"}]
  		"London" => [{student: "Anna", city: "London"}]
	}
	
	```
		
	To convert a Map to an Array, use ```Array.from```. For example, if we want to produce an array of ```key``` , ```value``` pairs, we can use: 
	
	```javascript
	Array.from(d3.group(student,d=>d.city), ([key, value]) => ({key, value}))
	```
	
	We can use the ```d3.rollup()``` function to aggregate the values for each group (e.g. sum, count, avg):
	
	```javascript
	let countStudentsByCity = d3.rollup(student,leaves=>leaves.length,d=>d.city)
	```
	
	If we transform the outpt Map to an array of key values pairs, we get an array with the number of students for each city:
	
	```javascript
	countStudentsByCity = [
		{ key: "Boston", value: 3 },
		{ key: "New York", value: 1 },
		{ key: "London", value: 1 }
	];
	```

5. **Implement the area chart**

	In the template we've given you code that draws an area chart. However, you'll need to wrangle the data for the visualization and add interactivity to the chart.

	The area chart should display the number of surveys that were conducted over time. Furthermore, it should enable the user to specify a desired time range which automatically influences the bar charts in the right column.

	1. Prepare the data in the ```wrangleData()``` function. You can use d3.rollup() again to count the number of surveys for each day. Make sure that you have the date variable stored as a date object and that the days are in correct order.
	2. Create an instance of the area chart class in `main.js`, passing in the data and the selector for the parent element you created in `index.html`
	3. Once done, an area chart should show up. Feel free to style the chart as you wish.
    
    &nbsp;

6. **Use a brushing component in your area chart as a time period filter**
	
	The idea of brushing is to allow the user to select a subset of data interactively. Changes are automatically reflected in the linked visualizations, which are the bar charts in our case.
	
	Initialize the brushing component (```d3.brushX()```) and append it to the drawing area. Whenever the user changes the selection, call the ```brushed()``` function in ```main.js```.

    &nbsp;

7. **Implement the ```brushed()``` function and connect it with the bar charts**

	Get the range of the selected region (start and end date) in the area chart and call the ```selectionChanged()``` function in all the linked bar charts.

    &nbsp;

8. **Use transitions to make changes smoother**

	Integrate D3's transitions into your bar charts (rectangles, labels).
	
	&nbsp;

9. **Make your webpage and your visualizations responsive**

	Until now, you have probably specified a fixed size for your SVG drawing areas every time. This is more convenient but actually far from ideal if you want to address users with different screen resolutions, which is our goal in most scenarios. 
	
	There are different ways of implementing more flexible visualizations. In our case, Bootstrap - a responsive, mobile-friendly front-end framework - makes it already very easy to create a responsive webpage, just by using the *fluid grid system* ([http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)). You can use the grid classes to set up the page layout and to define at which point columns should wrap onto a new line.
	
	 In addition, you can create your own CSS media queries to make individual adjustments (e.g. font size, spacings, ...) for different screen sizes. You can read more about it here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
 
    You should now be able to display the area and bar charts below each other if the screen is not wide enough. But this doesn't solve the problem of the fixed-sized SVG areas, so you need one further extension. Whenever you initialize a new visualization you can check the width of the parent container and set the SVG width accordingly. The height can remain unchanged.
 
    *Example for getting the width of a div element with Javascript:*
 
     ```javascript
     document.getElementById('elementId').getBoundingClientRect().width
     ```
 
    Try this concept in your current webpage and make the visualizations more flexible!
 
    &nbsp;
    
10. **Create a proper style for your webpage**

	Maintain good spacing between UI components, overall layout, font size, color scheme, etc.



## 2) Submit Homework in Quercus

Use the following recommended folder structure & create a single .zip file:

```
/submission_week_06_FirstnameLastname
    hw/
        css/ 		...folder with all CSS files
        js/ 		...folder with all JavaScript files
        data/ 		...filder with all data for the project, e.g. csv files, etc.
        [potential other folders you might have used for the project, such as a fonts or an img folder]
        index.html
            
    lab/
        css/ 		
        js/ 
        index.html
        
    class_activity/
    	[either pdf or link to google doc for the week's activity]
    	[latest Tableau workbook (either added here separately or within the gdrive)]
```

A few remarks based on some submissions we've seen:
*  *Please upload a single .zip file.*
*  *Please make sure to name the root folder of your submitted project submission_week_05_FirstnameLastname. We'll be starting to subtract points if you fail to do so because this will prevent us from automating the grading assignments.*
*  *When grading your project, the grader expect your project to work when simply running your index file. This means all data as well as all other files you might have used need to be part of the project submission. If a grader needs to add any additional files, such as adding a data folder with the original .csv file, we'll start subtracting points. The idea is that your submission is the equivalent of hosting the project on a live webserver that we're visiting & evaluating.*

**Congratulations on finishing this week's homework! See you in class!**
